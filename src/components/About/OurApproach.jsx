            <p >Strategic litigation isn't just about winning cases—it's about setting precedents, creating ripples of change, and making justice work for those who can't speak for themselves. For Lawyers for Animal Protection in Africa (LAPA), it's a powerful scalpel to dissect systemic gaps and a hammer to nail accountability to the wall.</p>
            <ul>
               <li><span className="font-semibold">Set Legal Benchmarks:</span> When you win a case, you don't just win for today—you win for the future. Precedents establish legal standards that can shield animals across the continent.</li>  
               <li><span className="font-semibold">Expose Loopholes:</span> Strategic litigation highlights the cracks in legislation and enforcement, compelling governments to seal these gaps for good.</li> 
               <li><span className="font-semibold">Shift the Narrative:</span> A high-profile case brings media attention and public awareness, turning the plight of animals into dinner table conversations.</li> 
               <li><span className="font-semibold">Hold Power to Account:</span> Corporations, traffickers, and even negligent authorities are forced to reckon with their actions when the legal system shines a spotlight on them.</li>
