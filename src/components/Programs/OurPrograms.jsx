          1. Marine Justice & Legal Advocacy Program
        </h2>
        <p className="font-serif">
          <strong>Objective:</strong>
          To strengthen Kenya’s legal and institutional frameworks for marine
          biodiversity protection by promoting robust, enforceable laws and
          accountability mechanisms that safeguard endangered marine species and
          ensure justice within the Blue Economy.
        </p>
        <h3 className="font-bold mt-2 mb-2">Why It Matters:</h3>
        <p className="font-serif">
          Legal frameworks are the backbone of conservation. However, Kenya’s
          existing laws and policies often lack specificity, enforcement power,
          or alignment with international best practices. Gaps in regulation,
          weak compliance mechanisms, and limited public participation in
          decision-making have left marine ecosystems vulnerable to
          exploitation, particularly through unregulated bycatch, IUU (Illegal,
          Unreported, and Unregulated) fishing, and poorly monitored licensing
          regimes.
        </p>
        <p className="font-serif">
          This program ensures that the rule of law is not just on paper, but
          implemented, enforced, and responsive to evolving ecological threats.

          2. Operation JAWS (Justice Against Wildlife Smugglers)
        </h2>
        <p className="font-serif">
          Operation JAWS is a bold and targeted investigative intervention led
          by the WAVES consortium, designed to expose and dismantle criminal
          syndicates involved in the trafficking of shark fins and other
          endangered marine species. The operation uses a mix of covert
          investigations, forensic intelligence, legal action, and strategic
          communications to bring high-level wildlife criminals to justice while
          galvanizing policy and enforcement reforms.
        </p>
        <p className="font-serif">
          The name “JAWS” is symbolic, turning the narrative away from the
          vilified shark to the true predators: transnational crime syndicates
          profiting from marine destruction.
        </p>
        <h3 className="font-bold mt-2 mb-2">Goals of Operation JAWS:</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Expose and disrupt organized shark fin trafficking operations active
            in Kenya and the Western Indian Ocean.
          </li>
          <li>
            Document evidence of environmental and economic crimes linked to
            illegal shark harvesting and export.
          </li>
          <li>
            Support legal action to arrest, charge, and prosecute high-profile
            traffickers.
          </li>
          <li>
            Raise public and political pressure to reform marine governance and
            improve international cooperation against wildlife crime.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <h3 className="font-bold mt-2  mb-2">Theory of Change:</h3>
        <h4 className="font-bold mb-2">Document → Inform → Disrupt</h4>
        <ol>
          <li>
            <strong>Document:</strong> Covertly investigate and collect
            credible, admissible evidence against key players, vessels, and
            companies engaged in illegal shark finning.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Inform: </strong>Disseminate findings through trusted media,
            stakeholder briefings, and public campaigns to generate pressure for
            action.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Disrupt:</strong>Use litigation, law enforcement
            collaboration, and global advocacy to dismantle trafficking
            operations and push for regulatory reform.
          </li>

          3. Education & Community Engagement
        </h2>
        <h3 className="font-bold mt-2 mb-2">Objectives:</h3>
        <p className="font-serif">
          To foster a culture of marine stewardship and conservation action
          among Kenya’s coastal communities—especially youth and artisanal
          fishers—through targeted education, outreach, and capacity-building
          programs that elevate local voices, traditional knowledge, and civic
          engagement.
        </p>
        <h3 className="font-bold mt-2 mb-2">Why It Matters:</h3>
        <p className="font-serif">
          Marine conservation cannot succeed without the meaningful
          participation of the people who live closest to the ocean. Yet, many
          coastal communities remain under-informed, underrepresented, and
          under-resourced in national and regional marine governance processes.
        </p>
        <p className="font-serif">
          Misconceptions about marine species (such as the vilification of
          sharks), coupled with economic pressures and limited access to legal
          and ecological information, often result in overfishing, harmful
          practices, or complicity in trafficking networks.
        </p>
        <p className="font-serif">
          This program bridges the knowledge-to-action gap by transforming
          passive awareness into active guardianship of Kenya’s marine
          ecosystems.
